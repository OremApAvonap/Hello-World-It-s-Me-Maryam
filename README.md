# Hello-World-It-s-Me-Maryam
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow, and introducing myself

My name is Maryam, I'm 27yo and after working 6 years as a Barista I've decided to change fields ans start a 2-year degree in Cybersecurity, IT, Networks and Electronics (BTS CIEL). I'm currently looking for a 24-month apprenticeship (weekly rhythm: 3d at the company, 2d at school) to get the most out of my degree and start having work experience as soon as I can.
